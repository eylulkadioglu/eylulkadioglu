# Hi there, I'm Eylul 👋

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable backend systems, designing clean APIs, and working on cloud-based solutions. I’ve worked with technologies like **Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, AWS, and JavaScript**, and enjoy solving complex problems that drive meaningful user experiences.

🌱 I'm currently learning: Advanced systems design, and contributing to open-source.

🔭 I’m currently working on: Full-stack projects using Flask and AWS (more updates soon!).

💼 I recently worked as a Software Engineer at [Center for Technology & Innovation](https://ctandi.org/), where I led backend development for a digital history project.
